Schematic of technology in the SMART-Seq Stranded Kit. SMART technology is used in a ligation-free protocol to preserve 
strand-of-origin information. Random priming (through the SMART scN6 Primer) allows the generation of cDNA from all RNA fragments 
in the sample, including rRNA. When the SMARTScribe™ Reverse Transcriptase (RT) reaches the 5’ end of the RNA fragment, the 
enzyme’s terminal transferase activity adds a few nontemplated nucleotides to the 3’ end of the cDNA (shown as Xs). The carefully 
designed SMART-Seq Stranded Adapter (included in the SMART scTSO Mix) base-pairs with the nontemplated nucleotide stretch, 
creating an extended template to enable the RT to continue replicating to the end of the oligonucleotide. The resulting cDNA contains 
sequences derived from the SMART scN6 Primer and the SMART-Seq Stranded Adapter. In the next step, a first round of PCR 
amplification (PCR1) adds full-length Illumina adapters, including barcodes. The 5’ PCR Primer binds to the SMART-Seq Stranded 
Adapter sequence (light purple), while the 3’ PCR Primer binds to sequence associated with the SMART scN6 sequence (green). The 
ribosomal cDNA (originating from rRNA) is then cleaved by scZapR in the presence of the mammalian-specific scR-Probes. This process 
leaves the library fragments originating from non-rRNA molecules untouched, with priming sites available on both 5’ and 3’ ends for 
further PCR amplification. These fragments are enriched via a second round of PCR amplification (PCR2) using primers universal to all 
libraries. The final library contains sequences allowing clustering on any Illumina flow cell.
